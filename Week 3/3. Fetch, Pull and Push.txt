1. There are 4 network commands:
   a. Clone
   b. Fetch: retreives new objects and references from the remote repository. Tracking branches are updated.
   c. Pull: Fetches and merges commits locally
   d. Push: Adds new objects and references to the remote repository
2. After perfoming, git fetch, doing git status would tell you if your local rep is behind your remote rep.
3. Pull: Combines git fetch with git merge FETCH_HEAD
   a. If objects are merged, then the tracking merge is merged into the current local branch
   b. This is similar to a topic branch merging into the base branch.
4. Git pull mergin options:
   a. --ff (default): fast forward if possible, otherwise only merge commits
   b. --no-ff - always include a merge commit
   c. --ff-only : cancel instead of doing a merge commit
   d. --rebase [--preserve-merges] 
5. git pull command:
   a. if pull is going to overwrite some files, to which you are already making changes, then it will gove error. In that case
      you would have to either stash or commit
   b. if not then oull is gonna work anyway
6. git push origin {branchname}
7. Rule: Always do a pull before push. This is because, any pushes amde without takign a pull, are gonna fail by default
