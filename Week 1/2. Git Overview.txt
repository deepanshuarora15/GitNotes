1. Version control can be thought of, from 3 different perspectives:
   a. Content : Complete history of the project is tracked and available at any time.
   b. Teams : Version control systems support many workflows. They also help in collaboration. It also helps in quality management,
      through team communication and reviews.
   c. Agility: helps in quick adaptability for change.
2. What type of content can  be managed? Ans: the version control system does not care about content type. As long as you think, a
   product will be subjected to continous improvements over periods of time, then version control is the way to go. 
3. Some of such examples are:
   a. Source Code
   b. Automated Tests
   c. Server configuration
   d. Documentation
   e. A book
   f. Website content
4. Distributed Version Control Systems:
   a. Each user has his own local copy of project history(repository) 
   b. Users can work offline.
   c. Remote /central repsitory : hosted on the cloud or the data centre
   d. Repositories can be synced via:
      a. Pushing content to , or
      b. Pulling content from the remote repsoitory
5. Git is a kind of distributed version control system
6. How can git be used?
   a. Command Line Interface
   b. graphical user interface. Eg: SourceTree
7. CLI is recommended as it is a required skill in the industry. Also, everything that can be done on command line is automatable.
   automating things is also an underlying principle of DevOps. Also, CLI is fast & easy. 
   Eg: git --version
8. SourceTree : Recommended as some tasks are easier via GUI. 
9. A repository contains the project history as commits. A commit is a snapshot of the entire project.
