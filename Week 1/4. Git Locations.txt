1. Working Tree : It is a location on your computer that contains the directories and files of your single commit.
   This is where you can view and edit the files of your project. 
2. Staging Area/ index : Contains the files that are planned for the next commit. Add command is used for this.
3. Local repository : Contains all the commits of a project.
4. Project directory = Working Tree + Staging Area + Local Repository. Staging are and local repository are maintained inside
   the .git file. 
5. Remote Repository: Located on cloud or datacentre. It contains the commits of the project. It is the single source of truth.


Steps to set up repository using CLI:

1. Make a central repository to store all your repositories on local
   mkdir repos
2. cd repos
3. Now make a repo, that we would be pushing to github
   mkdir myproj
4. cd myproj
5. git init
   This command will return a statement saying 'initalized empty git repository in myproj/.git/
6. We can now see the files in our folder:
   ls -a // -a flag is used to show hidden files also if any
   We will see a hidden file with .git extension is created
7. The .git file contians the staging area and local repository cotaining no commits as of now.
