1. If you have no local repository, then it's better to set up the remote repository on github first. It's easy via GUI.
   Then use git clone 'URL' to clone the repo to local.
   a. URL always ends with .git extension. It is the extension of remote repository
   b. If you want to repo to be downloaded with a new name, then
      git clone 'URL/to/projectname.git'
   c. All commits in the remote repo, are also in your local repos now
   d. git remote --verbose
      Displays info about the remote repo associated with the local repo. Shows the link from where you cloned it
2. If you have made a local repo and have made commits, and want to add those to the remote repo, then
   git remote add <name> <url>
   Eg: git remote add origin 'https://me@bitbucket.org/me/repoa.git'
3. All the commits that you do will by default be on the main/master branch.
4. git push origin branchname
   Note: origin is an alias for remote. If no alis is there then use 'https:///' or whatever the URL is
5. git remote -v
   This will give you the clone alias name
