1. There are two types of repository setups:
   a. Single repository
   b. Multi-repository
2. When do you open a PR?
   a. When the branch is created
   b. When you want comments on a branch
   c. When the branch is ready for review/merging
3. Single repository pull requests:
   a. Create a feature branch
   b. Optionally work on the feature branch
   c. Push the branch to the remote repository
4. Once you are done raising the PR and it has been reviewed, what we need to do is:
   a. Merge Commit: the merge creates a separate commit object ( git merge --no-ff )
   b. Squash - the entire branch is condensed to one linear commit ( git merge --squash)
