1. Commits can be associated with references. A reference is a user-friendly name that points to a commit's SHA-1 value or another
   reference. if a reference points to another reference, it's called a symbolic reference.
2. git log
   commit {SHA1-Value} (Head->master)
3. git show HEAD
   // the same commit as above would be shwon, with the same SHA-1 value, but with a little more detail than before.
4. A branch label, points to the most recent commit in a branch. It is also known as the tip of the branch.
   Branch labels are implemented as references.
5. Head is the reference to the current commit. As there can only be one current commit, it points to only one.
6. In image 1, Master label points to the most recent commit, while head points to the master label/
7. git status // shows recent commit with SHA1
   git show HEAD // shows the same but with a bit more detail
8. Prior commits can be seen by using ~
   git show Head ~
   Note: ~ is the same as ~ 1
   So this way, the first commit prior to current commit would be shown.
   git show Head ~3 shows commit , which is 3 prior to current commit
9. Annotation objects contain author name, date etc. This is what we can be seen using Git Lens
10. A tag is a refence to a specific commit. It is used to create labels on commits.
