1. A git object is used to store 4 types of things:
   a. Commit object : A small text file
   b. Annotated flag : A reference to a specific commit
   c. Tree : Directories and filenames in the project
   d. Blob: The content of a file in the project

   Out of these users generally only interact with 1a and 1b
2. These objects are stored by git in something known as object store.
3. git id is used for every commit. It's a SHA-1 value. So this way, every commit gets a unique git id.
   If the commit content is exactly the same, SHA-1 is same, but even if there is a minoscule difference between the commits,
   the SHA-1 value will have a huge difference
4. git hash-object filename1.text
   will return the SHA-1 value for it.
5. A git object name is the same as its git id
